**Project Explanation: Daily Goals Tracker**

### Overview:

**Daily Goals Tracker** is a web application built to help users set and track their daily goals. The application allows users to add, delete, and view their daily goals. Each goal is presented as a list item, and users can interact with the goals by adding new ones or removing completed ones. The application is built using React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.

### Technologies Used:

1. **React:**
   - **Why:** React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture and virtual DOM make it efficient and easy to develop interactive and dynamic applications. React's declarative syntax simplifies the code, making it more readable and maintainable.

2. **CSS:**
   - **Why:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used for styling the components, providing a visually appealing and consistent user interface. The use of CSS allows for easy customization and theming.

3. **GitHub:**
   - **Why:** GitHub is utilized for version control and collaborative development. It enables multiple contributors to work on the project simultaneously, and it provides a centralized repository for managing the codebase.

### Component Structure:

1. **CourseInput:**
   - Handles the input form for adding new daily goals.
   - Uses React state to manage the entered value and form validity.
   - Utilizes the Button component for the "Add Goal" button.

2. **Button:**
   - A reusable button component for consistent styling.
   - Accepts different button types and click handlers as props.
   - Improves code readability and maintainability.

3. **CourseGoalList:**
   - Displays the list of daily goals using the CourseGoalItem component.
   - Maps through the list of goals and dynamically renders each item.
   - Passes the goal text and ID to CourseGoalItem as props.

4. **CourseGoalItem:**
   - Represents an individual daily goal item.
   - Allows users to delete a goal by clicking on the goal item.
   - Communicates with the parent component to trigger the deletion.

5. **App:**
   - Serves as the main container for the application.
   - Manages the state for the list of daily goals.
   - Implements functions for adding and deleting goals.
   - Renders the CourseInput and CourseGoalList components.

### Workflow:

1. **Adding a Goal:**
   - Users input their daily goal in the CourseInput component.
   - Validation ensures that empty goals are not added.
   - The entered goal is added to the list when the "Add Goal" button is clicked.

2. **Deleting a Goal:**
   - Users can delete a goal by clicking on the respective goal item in the CourseGoalList.
   - The App component manages the state and updates the list accordingly.

### Why This Approach:

1. **React for Dynamic UI:**
   - React's component-based architecture allows for modular development, making it easier to manage and scale the application.

2. **Reusable Components:**
   - The use of reusable components (e.g., CourseInput, Button) improves code organization and reduces redundancy.

3. **GitHub for Version Control:**
   - GitHub provides a robust version control system, facilitating collaboration and enabling easy tracking of changes.

4. **Simplicity and Readability:**
   - The application is designed to be straightforward and easy to use, with a clean and minimalistic user interface.

5. **Responsive Design:**
   - CSS is utilized for responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.

In summary, the Daily Goals Tracker is a simple yet effective web application that leverages React for its dynamic interface, reusable components for maintainability, and GitHub for collaborative development. The project is designed with a focus on user experience and code readability, making it accessible for users to manage and track their daily goals.
